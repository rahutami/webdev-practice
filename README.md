Web Development Practice codes
-
1. Login Form

   Well just, a login form.

2. Survey Form

    A survey form with multiple kinds of form tags to practice form tags.

3. Interval Color Change

    My first time making a dynamic "webpage" using javascript. The color of the background and the text change every 1.5 seconds

4. Color Change Button

     The background color will change to a random color every time the button is clicked.

5. Tic Tac Toe

   A simple tic tac toe game! This one still needs some improvements since the board doesn't know when a player has won, so the player needs to manually reset the board.
